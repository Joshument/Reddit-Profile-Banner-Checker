# Reddit-Profile-Banner-Checker
A discord bot made to notify people when a user on reddit changes their banner or profile picture.

This program was originally made for the AlexMaestro ARG, as such the default users are u/AlexMaestro, u/AveryMasters, and u/Fac50Log11013.

Requires the modules sqlite3, discord.py, and requests. I would make a compiled version but windows decides that the compiled version is a trojan so uhhh

If there's an issue with any release, please contact me on Discord @ Joshument#0001 with your issue and I will try to fix it as best as I can
