# Reddit-Profile-Banner-Checker
A discord bot made to notify people when a user on reddit changes their banner or profile picture.

This program was originally made for the AlexMaestro ARG, as such the default users are u/AlexMaestro, u/AveryMasters, and u/Fac50Log11013.
Make sure to comment out lines 23 and 24 after running it once or else it will notifiy you for every user on the list on program startup. Will fix in the future but I'm too lazy right now and it's not god awful.

If there's an issue with any release, please contact me on Discord @ Joshument#0001 with your issue and I will try to fix it as best as I can
